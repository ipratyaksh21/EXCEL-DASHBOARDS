# EXCEL: SALES DISTRIBUTION DASHBOARD
In this Excel Project, I have worked on Two Tables named Input Data and Target.<br> 
Then, I created another worksheet named Analysis,<br>
where I created Pivot Tables and used Advanced Excel formulas to gather Insights.<br>
Finally, I generated Excel Dashboard where I demonstrated: <br>
Total Sales<br>
Top 3 Customers<br>
Top 10 Products<br>
Weekly Sales<br>
Monthly Sales<br>
Sales by Regions and Countries<br>
Overall, I used various charts to showcase the Insights.<br>
Moreover, I added Month and Region Slicers for more in-depth results.
